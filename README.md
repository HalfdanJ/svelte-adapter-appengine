# svelte-adapter-appengine

Utilize the [Google Cloud App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) infrastructure to host SvelteKit content.

[![Tests](https://github.com/halfdanj/svelte-adapter-appengine/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/halfdanj/svelte-adapter-appengine/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## Setup

In your standard SvelteKit project:

- `npm install --save-dev svelte-adapter-appengine`
- add adapter to `svelte.config.js`:

```diff
+import adapter from "svelte-adapter-appengine";

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
export default {
  kit: {
+   adapter: adapter({
+     useCloudLogging: true
+   }),
    target: "#svelte",
  },
};
```

- `npm run build`.
- Application can then be deployed by running `gcloud app deploy --project <CLOUD_PROJECT_ID> build/app.yaml`. (learn more about gcloud utility [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud))

## Configuration

Following options are available

- `out`: Output directory of build step, defaults to `/build`
- `useCloudLogging`: Enable or disable [Google Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/overview). When enabled, `console.log`, `console.error` and so on show up with more metadata in Cloud Logging dashboard, and log messages are bundled by request trace id's. Enabled by default.
- `external`: Node modules that the esbuild step should mark as external.
- `dependencies`: Node modules that should be added to `package.json` file in the build step. These modules will be fetched when the application is deployed.
- `nodejsRuntime`: Node version to use in appengine runtime. See available runtimes [here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/runtime). Defaults to `16`

The generated `app.yaml` file can be customized by adding a file named `app.yaml` in the root of the project. The adapter will merge this file with the generated `app.yaml` file, enabling for example custom machine types, added routes or any other [app.yaml configuration](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/reference/app-yaml?tab=node.js)

## Adapter Output

The SSR part of SvelteKit is hosted on App Engine in a nodejs runtime. It's running using [polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka) mimicking [@sveltejs/adapter-node
](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-node).

Static files are served directly from Cloud Storage without going through the nodejs webserver. Routes for all the static assets are automatically generated in `app.yaml` by the adapter.

## Example

An examplee app can be accessed on [https://svelte-demo-329602.uc.r.appspot.com/](https://svelte-demo-329602.uc.r.appspot.com/), this is the default demo app from sveltekit deployed with the default settings.
